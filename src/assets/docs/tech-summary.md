### **React Tenzies ‚Äî Interactive Dice Game**

*Built with React, Vite, and modern JavaScript (ES6+)*

* Developed a responsive mini-game using **React functional components** and **Hooks** (`useState`, `useRef`) to manage state and focus control.
* Designed a **single source of truth architecture**, with all game logic in the parent component and reusable, stateless child components.
* Implemented **accessibility features** including `aria-pressed`, `aria-live`, and keyboard-navigable dice controls; used refs for non-re-rendering focus management.
* Applied **lazy state initialization**, **immutability**, and conditional rendering for efficient updates and dynamic UI transitions.
* Styled the interface with **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for mobile-first responsiveness; integrated **react-confetti** and **react-use** for animated effects.
* Documented architecture, future improvements, and refactoring plans in a structured **README** and `future-todos.md` roadmap.

**Tech:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), Vite, CSS3 (Grid/Flexbox), nanoid, react-confetti, react-use, ESLint, Accessibility (a11y), Responsive Design

## üíº React Tenzies ‚Äî Technical Summary

**React Tenzies** is a fully interactive mini-game built with **React (Vite)**, designed to demonstrate mastery of component-based architecture, modern state management, accessibility, and UI responsiveness.

The project applies key front-end engineering principles, including **clean state modeling, immutability, accessibility (a11y), and UI performance optimization**.

### üß† Core Technical Competencies Demonstrated

#### ‚öôÔ∏è React & State Management

* Implemented React functional components with **Hooks** (`useState`, `useRef`) for state and focus control.
* Used **lazy state initialization** to prevent unnecessary computations on re-renders.
* Modeled complex component state as **structured objects**, ensuring immutability and predictable updates.
* Applied **conditional rendering** for dynamic UI updates (game states, button labels, and confetti triggers).

#### üß© Component Architecture

* Designed a **single source of truth** architecture: all dice state managed in the parent component (`App`), children receive props and callbacks.
* Built **stateless, reusable components** (`Die.jsx`) with clear props and internal accessibility logic.
* Followed **separation of concerns** ‚Äî logic isolated from presentation for maintainability and scalability.

#### üé® Styling & Responsiveness

* Created a **mobile-first responsive layout** using **CSS Grid and Flexbox**.
* Applied inline and conditional styling for held dice states, and planned refactoring to CSS modules for scalability.
* Integrated **react-confetti** and **react-use** libraries to produce dynamic, viewport-responsive animations.

#### üß± Code Quality & Tooling

* Developed using **Vite** for fast builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
* Followed **ESLint** standards for code consistency and readability.
* Used **nanoid** for unique key generation in React list rendering (avoiding common pitfalls with array indices).
* Documented architecture and improvements through a **structured README** and a **`future-todos.md` roadmap**.

#### ‚ôø Accessibility (a11y)

* Implemented **ARIA attributes** (`aria-pressed`, `aria-live`, `role="status"`) to support assistive technologies.
* Ensured **keyboard navigation** and visible focus outlines for all interactive elements.
* Used **refs** for programmatic focus management without triggering re-renders.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance and Maintainability

* Avoided redundant computations (e.g., minimized `.every()` calls).
* Used pure functions (`generateAllNewDice`) and immutable updates to reduce side effects.
* Scoped component state to reduce re-render frequency and improve responsiveness.

#### üß™ Testing & Future-Proofing

* Planned for **unit testing** (Vitest/Jest) for logic verification (win detection, dice rolls).
* Outlined future enhancements including **state persistence**, **dark mode**, and **animations** in structured documentation.

### üß© Why This Project Demonstrates Professional Readiness

This project showcases both **technical proficiency** and **engineering maturity**.
It reflects:

* Understanding of **React‚Äôs data flow, hooks, and component lifecycle**.
* Awareness of **user experience and accessibility standards**.
* Ability to **write maintainable, self-documenting code** with clear architecture.
* Proactive **refactoring mindset**, separating UI, logic, and reusable components.
* Experience working with **modern tooling** (Vite, ESLint, npm ecosystem).

Together, these demonstrate readiness to contribute to front-end teams using **React, TypeScript, or modern JavaScript stacks**, with a focus on **code clarity, accessibility, and scalability**.
