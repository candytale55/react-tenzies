# 🎲 React Tenzies

## Description

A self-contained React mini-game built to practice React fundamentals, state management, accessibility, and responsive design — packaged into a clean, production-ready example app.

The goal is simple: roll until all dice show the same number. Click a die to **hold** its value between rolls and continue until every die matches.

---

## Technologies

* **React (Vite)** – component-based architecture, fast HMR
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – core logic and interactivity
* **CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox)** – responsive, mobile-first layout
* **ESLint (Vite default)** – linting and code quality rules

---

## Libraries & Tools

* **nanoid** – generates unique IDs for each die
* **react-confetti** – adds celebratory confetti when the game is won
* **react-use** – provides window size detection for responsive confetti behavior

## Useful Setup Information

This project was bootstrapped with **Vite + React**.
It includes a minimal configuration with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint.

### Available Vite Plugins

Two official React plugins are supported for HMR and fast refresh:

* [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) — uses **Babel**
* [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) — uses **SWC**, a faster alternative

### ESLint Configuration

Vite includes a base ESLint setup.
For production-grade apps, it’s recommended to:

* Use **TypeScript** for stronger typing.
* Enable **type-aware lint rules** via [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).
  See the [Vite React + TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for reference.

## Future Improvements (TODO)

### Code Quality

* Refactor logic into a `useTenziesGame` custom hook to separate UI from state.
* Optimize win condition checks — compute `allHeld` and `allSameValue` once.
* Abstract dice creation into a `generateDie()` helper.
* Add Jest/Vitest unit tests for dice and win condition logic.

### Accessibility

* Add visible focus outlines (`:focus-visible`).
* Add `role="status"` to live region for screen readers.

### UX / UI

* Move inline styles to CSS classes (e.g., `.die.held`).
* Add roll animations with CSS or Framer Motion.
* Include settings for dark mode or sound effects.
* Display roll count and timer for performance tracking.

### State & Persistence

* Store best scores and roll count in `localStorage`.
* Persist ongoing game state between sessions.

### Extra Credit Ideas

1. Replace numbers with real dice pips.
2. Add leaderboards or challenge modes.

---

## Notes to Future Self

* Check [future-todos](./docs/future-todos.md) for additional ideas.
* Keep all dice state in the parent (`App`) to maintain a single source of truth.
* Avoid derived or duplicated state in child components.
* Use **refs** for DOM focus management without re-rendering.

---

### Why Refs Are Used

Refs provide a direct handle to DOM elements **without triggering re-renders**.
They’re ideal for managing focus (e.g., focusing “New Game” after a win) and for integrating libraries that require direct DOM access.
This preserves React’s declarative model while maintaining precise control.
